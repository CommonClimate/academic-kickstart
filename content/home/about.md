# Biography

Julien Emile-Geay [joolee-uh-n ameel-jay] studies how climate varies on timescales comparable to a human lifetime: the bassline of climate’s music. Using deterministic and probabilistic models, he creates mathematical representations of the climate system to shed light on its long-term behavior.  He is particularly interested in constraining how much of climate variations arise from within, or are being triggered by external factors, natural or human. Beyond climate science, he also teaches the art of making reliable inferences from data, which is increasingly needed to cut through the cloud of misinformation. Professor Emile-Geay is passionate about educating people of all levels of scientific literacy to the reality of man-made global warming, using knowledge to empower individuals to generate positive change.
